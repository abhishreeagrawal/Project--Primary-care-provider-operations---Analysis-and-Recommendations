# Project--Primary_care_provider_operations_Analysis_and_Recommendations
Analysis of health claims data for primary care practitioners to improve patient health and reduce costs.  

<b> Problem Statement: </b>
Company X (a group of primary care providers) has a shared savings/risk agreement with a Regional Health Plan (the Health Insurer). 
In a shared savings or risk agreement, if the providers spend more money than the benchmark, the percentage of loss is paid by the providers back to the Health plan. Whereas, if the spend is within the benchmark, the percentage of savings above it, is shared with the participant providers. 
Therefore, Company X is looking for ways to improve the quality of primary care provided to the patients while keeping the medical expenses below the allocated budget!

The objective of this project is to analyze the provided claims and demographic data to provide recommendations for improving the Triple Aim.
